    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: No description is available for this CVE. \n            STATEMENT: The severity for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections has been set to Moderate because, the vulnerability requires an attacker to have \"database-level CREATE privilege to execute arbitrary code as the bootstrap superuser\". As, it requires HIGH privileged user, which reduces the impact of this vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is not affected by this issue as PostgreSQL was decommissioned on the latest Red Hat Openshift Dev Spaces 3.6 release, as described in: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_dev_spaces/3.6/html/release_notes_and_known_issues/removed-functionalities#removed-functionality-crw-4105\n\nRed Hat Satellite does not include the affected PostgreSQL, however, the component is shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and consumed by Satellite. Red Hat Satellite users are advised to check the impact of Red Hat Enterprise Linux since any necessary fixes will also be distributed through it.",
